# Airbnb Data Analysis using Machine Learning Algorithms

This project analyzes Airbnb data of the properties located in and near Seattle area. The analysis is done for investors interested in converting Airbnb properties into rentals. The projects helps them choose which properties to invest in and what factors to consider before investing in a probable profitable property. <br/>
<br/>
The project uses a variety of Machine Learning algorithms including Regression, Random Forest and XGBoost. It extracts a number of dependent factors to consider for a property to be profitable using Regression algorithms.<br/>
<br/>
This was a part of a Kaggle competition where it achieved an accuracy score of 89%, based on AUC.<br/>
